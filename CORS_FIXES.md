# CORS and Network Error Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. CORS Errors from eth.merkle.io
- **Problem**: The application was trying to connect to `eth.merkle.io` which has CORS restrictions
- **Solution**: Switched to LlamaRPC endpoints which are CORS-friendly and more reliable

### 2. Coinbase Analytics 401 Errors
- **Problem**: RainbowKit was trying to send analytics to Coinbase endpoints that were returning 401 errors
- **Solution**: Disabled RainbowKit analytics and automatic wallet connection

### 3. Network Timeout and Connection Issues
- **Problem**: RPC endpoints were timing out or failing to connect
- **Solution**: Implemented better error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated RPC Endpoints (`config/wagmi.ts`)
- Switched from problematic endpoints to LlamaRPC endpoints
- Added environment-specific configurations
- Improved error handling in chain configurations

### 2. Enhanced WagmiProvider (`components/WagmiProvider.tsx`)
- Disabled RainbowKit analytics to prevent Coinbase tracking errors
- Disabled automatic wallet connection
- Improved QueryClient configuration with better retry logic
- Added network mode settings

### 3. Updated CSP Headers (`next.config.js`)
- Added LlamaRPC endpoints to Content Security Policy
- Ensured all necessary RPC endpoints are allowed

### 4. Added Error Handling
- Created ErrorBoundary component for graceful error handling
- Added RPC helper utilities with fallback mechanisms
- Created API proxy route for handling CORS issues

### 5. New Components and Utilities
- `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`: Catches and displays errors gracefully
- `utils/rpc-helpers.ts`: Provides fallback RPC endpoints and retry logic
- `pages/api/rpc-proxy.ts`: API route for proxying RPC requests

## RPC Endpoints Used

### Primary Endpoints (LlamaRPC)
- **Mainnet**: `https://eth.llamarpc.com`
- **Polygon**: `https://polygon.llamarpc.com`
- **Optimism**: `https://optimism.llamarpc.com`
- **Arbitrum**: `https://arbitrum.llamarpc.com`
- **Base**: `https://base.llamarpc.com`
- **Zora**: `https://rpc.zora.energy`
- **Avalanche**: `https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`

### Fallback Endpoints
Each chain has multiple fallback endpoints configured in `utils/rpc-helpers.ts` for redundancy.

## Error Handling Improvements

### 1. QueryClient Configuration
- Reduced retry attempts from 3 to 2
- Added specific error detection for CORS and network issues
- Reduced maximum retry delay to 10 seconds
- Disabled mutation retries

### 2. Error Boundary
- Catches React errors and displays user-friendly messages
- Provides "Try Again" functionality
- Logs errors for debugging

### 3. RPC Fallbacks
- Multiple endpoints per chain for redundancy
- Automatic fallback on connection failures
- Exponential backoff for retries

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Clear your browser cache and local storage
2. **Test Wallet Connection**: Try connecting different wallets
3. **Check Console**: Monitor the browser console for any remaining errors
4. **Network Tab**: Check the Network tab to ensure RPC calls are successful

## Monitoring

### Console Errors to Watch For
- ✅ Should be resolved: CORS errors from `eth.merkle.io`
- ✅ Should be resolved: 401 errors from `cca-lite.coinbase.com`
- ✅ Should be reduced: Network timeout errors

### Expected Behavior
- Wallet connections should work more reliably
- Fewer network errors in console
- Better user experience with graceful error handling

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors:

1. **Check Network Connectivity**: Ensure stable internet connection
2. **Try Different Wallet**: Test with MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.
3. **Clear Browser Data**: Clear cache, cookies, and local storage
4. **Check Environment**: Ensure you're using the correct environment variables

## Future Improvements

1. **Add More Fallback Endpoints**: Consider adding more RPC providers
2. **Implement Circuit Breaker**: Add circuit breaker pattern for failing endpoints
3. **Add Monitoring**: Implement proper error tracking and monitoring
4. **User Feedback**: Add user-friendly error messages and recovery options
